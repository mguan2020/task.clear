## What it task.clear?
Productivity is often the number one priority for many people. All of us has experienced assignments and projects pile up throughout the week: the problem our app aims to solve.

task.clear seeks to improve student productivity. On the user dashboard, the app provides a to-do list of assignments categorized by the classes they are for. It times how long it takes the user to complete a task from start to finish. It uses that data to provide analytics about the average amount of time spent per class and the total number of study hours the user spent on each class each week. In addition, the app supports collaboration among users by posting a feed of other people doing similar assignments and allowing them to send/accept requests to meet up at a specific time and location to work together.
